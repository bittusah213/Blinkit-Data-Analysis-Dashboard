## Project Objective:
### The Blinkit dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, item distribution, and outlet efficiency. It highlights key metrics such as total sales, average sales, number of items, and customer ratings. The dashboard also breaks down performance by fat content, item types, outlet size, and location to help identify trends and optimize inventory and sales strategies across different store formats.
